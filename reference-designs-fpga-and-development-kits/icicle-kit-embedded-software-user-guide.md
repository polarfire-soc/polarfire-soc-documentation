## Introduction

The PolarFire SoC Icicle Kit features an MPFS250T_ES PolarFire SoC device.
Microchip's PolarFire SoC devices combine a RISC-V 5x core Microprocessor Subsystem capable of running Linux and the PolarFire FPGA fabric in a single device.
This powerful combination enables the partitioning of user designs between the Microprocessor Subsystem (MSS) and the FPGA fabric.
Microchip's Libero SoC enables the rapid development of RTL based designs for PolarFire SoC and many other device families.
Libero SoC provides a wide range of IP for a variety of applications such as video and imaging, signal processing, wired and wireless communications, and networking.
Microchip's SoftConsole IDE enables the rapid development of C/C++ source code based applications targeted for all Microchip FPGA and SoC device families.

## Coming out of the box

The board is pre-programmed with a reference design booting Linux from eMMC.

Connect the Icicle Kit's *USB- UART Terminal* connector (J11) to your host computer. Use the terminal software of your choice (Putty ExtraPutty, minicom, screen) to open serial connections to the four UARTs available though the J11 USB connector. **Serial port settings: 115220 baud, no flow control, no parity**. Power cycle the board. This should result in boot messages appearing on two of the serials ports.

MMUART0 displays the Hart Software Service (HSS) boot messages. MMUART1 displays U-Boot messages, Linux boot messages and provides a Linux prompt. The default user name is "root". No password is required. If a password is requested at any stage "microchip" is used as default password.

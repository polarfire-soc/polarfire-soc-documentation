## Updating

<a name="fpga-fabric-and-envm"></a>

### FPGA fabric and eNVM

A FlashPro Express programming job file is provided as an asset with each release of a kit's reference design in the PolarFire SoC GitHub organisation - kit user guides should be consulted for links to the reference design repositories for indivdiual kits.
These programming job files will program the FPGA fabric with the latest reference configuration and also program the eNVM with the latest HSS payload.
The .zip file in the release assets should be downloaded and extracted to access the programming job file.

<a name="linux-image"></a>

### Linux image

The [PolarFire SoC Yocto BSP](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/repo-meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp) and [Microchip Buildroot External](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/repo-microchip-buildroot-external) repositories allow users to create a minimal Linux image for several development kits. Alternatively, a pre-built minimal Linux image is provided as an asset in the Meta PolarFire SoC Yocto BSP releases [page](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/releases-meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp).

Linux images with a '.wic' or ".wic.gz" file extension use a GUID partition table (GPT) and are suitable for programming to the eMMC or an SD card. For Microchip Buildroot External, an image with the name `sdcard.img` is use instead. For more information on how to program any of these images into storage, plese refer to the steps outlined in the [eMMC](#emmc) or [SD](#sd-card-content-update-procedure) sections.

Linux images created using the PolarFire SoC Yocto BSP layer and named per the `<image>-<machine>-<timestamp>.<flash-type>.mtdimg` format, for example, `core-image-minimal-mtdutils-icicle-kit-es-yyyyMMddHHmmSS.nand.mtdimg` or `core-image-minimal-mtdutils-icicle-kit-es-yyyyMMddHHmmSS.nor.mtdimg` are suitable for programming to a QSPI flash device using the HSS. For Microchip Buildroot External, images with the name `nand.img` or `nor.img` are used instead.

For more information on how to program images to QSPI flash devices, please follow the steps outlined in the [External QSPI Flash Memory](#external-qspi-flash-memory) section.

When updating a kit as shown in this section, make sure to keep both the reference design and Linux image versions in sync by using the latest release assets.

#### Programming a Linux Image

<a name="emmc"></a>

##### eMMC

A PolarFire SoC kit's eMMC content is written by the Hart Software Services (HSS) using the `usbdmsc` command. The HSS `usbdmsc` command exposes the eMMC as a USB mass storage device through a USB-OTG connector.

If both QSPI and MMC services are enabled in the HSS, you must specify the default device to be programmed before running the `usbdmsc` command. For example, to program the eMMC using USBDMSC service, you must enter the `mmc` command before running the `usbdmsc` command.

<a name="emmc-content-update-procedure"></a>

###### eMMC content update procedure

Before proceeding with the steps shown below, prepare the Linux image that you want to program to the kit. This could be:

- A pre-built image downloaded from the PolarFire SoC Yocto BSP [releases](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/releases-meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp)
- An `sdcard.img` image created using [Microchip Buildroot External](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/repo-microchip-buildroot-external)

Note: If using an image generated with the PolarFire SoC Yocto BSP, please extract the image so it has the ".wic" extension. Compressed images, i.e with the ".wic.gz" extension should not be programmed as this can cause issues at boot time.

1. Connect the USB-UART connector to your host PC. This connection will give you access to the PolarFire SoC UARTs
2. Open a terminal application to interact with the HSS through MMUART0. Settings are 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, and no flow control.
3. Power on the board and the Microchip logo will be displayed on MMUART0 as the HSS boots.
4. Press a key in the terminal application to stop the HSS from booting. This will give you access to the HSS command line interface and a ">>" for input will be displayed in the terminal.
5. Type `mmc` to select mmc as a boot source and then `usbdmsc` in the HSS command line interface. If successful, a message saying "Waiting for USB Host to connect" will be displayed.
6. Connect the USB-OTG connector to your host PC. The eMMC content will be transferred to the kit through this connection.
7. The eMMC should now appear as mass storage device/drive on your host PC.
8. Launch USBImager

9. Select the *Image file* you would like to program to the eMMC. Note: Linux images are generated with a time stamp; assets from different releases will have different names.

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/select-file.png)

10. Select the target *Device* to program the image to.

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/select-device.png)

11. Click *Write*.

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/write.png)

12. Once writing has completed, unmount/eject the drive from the host PC and press `CTRL+C` in the HSS command line interface. Disconnect the micro-USB cable from the USB-OTG connector.
13. Type `boot` to boot the newly copied Linux image.
14. HSS boot messages will appear on MMUART0 and the Linux boot will appear on MMUART1.

<a name="sd-card-content-update-procedure"></a>

##### SD Card content update procedure

Before proceeding with the steps shown below, prepare the Linux image that you want to program to the kit. This could be:

- A pre-built image downloaded from the PolarFire SoC Yocto BSP [releases](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/releases-meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp)
- An `sdcard.img` image created using [Microchip Buildroot External](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/repo-microchip-buildroot-external)

Note: If using an image generated with the PolarFire SoC Yocto BSP, please extract the image so it has the ".wic" extension. Compressed images, i.e with the ".wic.gz" extension should not be programmed as this can cause issues at boot time.

1. Insert an SD card into the SD card reader of your host PC

2. Launch USBImager

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/start.png)

3. Select *Image file* that was extracted in step 3. Note: Yocto Linux images are generated with a time stamp, assets from different releases will have different names.

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/select-file.png)

4. Select the *Device*.

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/select-device.png)

5. Click *Write*.

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/write.png)

6. Once writing has completed, eject the SD card from the host PC.
7. Insert the SD card into the kit's SD card slot and power on the board.
8. HSS boot messages will appear on MMUART0 and the Linux boot will appear on MMUART1. The expected HSS output for a successful boot from eMMC is shown below:

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/hss-boot.png)

##### External QSPI Flash Memory

PolarFire SoC supports booting Linux from QSPI by connecting an external QSPI flash memory.

For more information on the QSPI flash memory devices supported, please refer to the [booting from QSPI](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/booting-from-qspi_booting-from-qspi) documentation.

The external QSPI flash memory can be programmed using the Hart Software Services (HSS) using the `usbdmsc` command. The HSS `usbdmsc` command exposes the QSPI flash memory as a USB mass storage device through the USB-OTG connector.

If both QSPI and an MMC services are enabled in the HSS, you must specify the default device to be programmed before running the `usbdmsc` command. For example, to program the external QSPI flash memory using USBDMSC service, you must use the `qspi` command before running `usbdmsc` command.

###### External QSPI Flash Content Update Procedure

1. Connect the USB-UART connector to your host PC. This connection will give you access to 4 of the PolarFire SoC UARTs
2. Open a terminal application to interact with the HSS through MMUART0. Settings are 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, and no flow control.
3. Power on the board and the Microchip logo will be displayed on MMUART0 as the HSS boots.
4. Press a key in the terminal application to stop the HSS from booting. This will give you access to the HSS command line interface and a ">>" for input will be displayed in the terminal.
5. Type `qspi` to select QSPI as the boot source  and then type `usbdmsc` in the HSS command line interface. If successful, a message saying "Waiting for USB Host to connect" will be displayed.
6. Connect the USB-OTG connector to your host PC. The content will be transferred to the external QSPI flash memory through this connection.
7. The QSPI flash connected to the kit should now appear as mass storage device/drive on your host PC.
8. Download the asset for the Linux image that you want to program to the kit from the PolarFire SoC Yocto BSP [releases](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/releases-meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp). The asset should have a `.mtdimg` file extension. Alternatively, create a "nand.img" or "nor.img" image using [Microchip Buildroot External](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/repo-microchip-buildroot-external).
9. Launch USBImager

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/start.png)

10. Select the *Image file* that was downloaded in step 8. Note: Yocto Linux images are generated with a time stamp; assets from different releases will have different names.

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/select-file-flash.png)

11. Select the target *Device* to program the image to.

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/select-device-flash.png)

12. Click *Write*.

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/write-flash.png)

13. Once writing has completed, unmount/eject the drive from the host PC and press `CTRL+C` in the HSS command line interface. Disconnect the micro-USB cable from the USB-OTG connector.

14. A progress bar will show up, indicating that the image is being transfered to the QSPI flash that is connected.

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/transfer-flash-wait.png)

15. Once the transfer has completed, the HSS console shoud look as shown in the image below

    ![](./images/updating-mpfs-kit/flash-transfer-complete.png)

16. Type `boot` to boot the newly copied Linux image.

17. HSS boot messages will appear on MMUART0 and the Linux boot will appear on MMUART1.

### Ubuntu Server Image

An Ubuntu preinstalled server image is available for the Icicle Kit on the official [Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download/risc-v).

This section describes how to program an Ubuntu server image to an SD card or on-board eMMC on the Icicle Kit.

Before proceeding with the steps below, make sure you are using the latest Icicle Kit Reference Design.

A FlashPro Express programming job file is provided as an asset with each release of a Icicle Kit Reference Design. For more information, please refer to the [Icicle Kit Reference Design GitHub release page](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/releases-icicle-kit-reference-design).

For information on how to program a FLash Pro Express programming job file to the Icicle Kit, please refer to the "Using FlashPro Express" section in the [PolarFire SoC Software Tool Flow](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/software-development_polarfire-soc-software-tool-flow) documentation.

1. Download the preinstalled Ubuntu server image for the Icicle Kit. For Ubuntu 22.04.2 (Jammy Jellyfish), the image is available on the [Ubuntu Releases site](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/icicle-kit-ubuntu-server-image)

2. Extract the image using a file archiver such as 7-Zip on Windows. Alternatively, if using Linux, the image can be extracted using the following command:

    ```bash
    unxz ubuntu-22.04.2-preinstalled-server-riscv64+icicle.img.xz
    ```

3. Program the image extracted in the step above to either the on-board eMMC or an SD card.

    To program the image to the eMMC using USBImager, please follow the steps shown in the "eMMC content update procedure" section.  
    To program the image to the SD card using USBImager, please follow the steps shown in the "SD Card content update procedure" section.  

    Alternatively, if using Linux, the image can be programmed using from using the `dd` command:

    ```bash
    sudo dd if=ubuntu-22.04.2-preinstalled-server-riscv64+icicle.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M conv=fsync
    ```

    You will have to replace /dev/sdX by the actual device name of your SD card. Please, be especially cautious not to overwrite the wrong drive as this cannot be undone.

4. Power cycle the board. HSS boot messages will appear on MMUART0 and the Linux console will appear on MMUART1.

    When booting for the first time after programming an image, Ubuntu uses cloud-init to configure the environment, including the default login credentials.  
    This can be somewhat misleading, as the login prompt will appear but attempting to log in will fail.  
    The cloud-init process takes several minutes to run, and until it has completed it is not possible to log in.  
    When cloud-init has completed, you will see the the following:  

    ```bash
    [  203.319164] cloud-init[1375]: Cloud-init v. 22.4.2-0ubuntu0~22.04.1 finished at Fri, 09 Sep 2022 18:49:49 +0000. Da tasource DataSourceNoCloud [seed=/var/lib/cloud/seed/nocloud-net][dsmode=net].  Up 203.22 seconds
    ```

At this point you can login with user `ubuntu` and default password `ubuntu`.  
Subsequent boots do not require cloud-init, and login is possible once the prompt is reached.

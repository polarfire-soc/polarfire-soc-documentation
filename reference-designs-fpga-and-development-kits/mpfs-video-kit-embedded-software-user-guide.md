## Introduction

The PolarFire® SoC Video Kit features an MPFS250TS PolarFire SoC device.
Microchip's PolarFire SoC devices combine a RISC-V 5x core Microprocessor Subsystem capable of running Linux and the PolarFire FPGA fabric in a single device.
This powerful combination enables the partitioning of user designs between the Microprocessor Subsystem (MSS) and the FPGA fabric.
Microchip's Libero SoC enables the rapid development of RTL based designs for PolarFire SoC and many other device families.
Libero SoC provides a wide range of IP for a variety of applications such as video and imaging, signal processing, wired and wireless communications, and networking.
Microchip's SoftConsole IDE enables the rapid development of C/C++ source code based applications targeted for all Microchip FPGA and SoC device families.

The PolarFire SoC Video kit is the industry’s first RISC-V SoC FPGA-based, full-featured embedded vision
development platform.
It targets secure, reliable, and power-efficient vision applications at the edge, industrial IoT and automation.
It supports Microchip’s VectorBlox neural network accelerator IP and SDK.

The kit features dual 4K MIPI CSI-2 cameras, HDMI 2.0 ports with FMC-based expansion towards CoaXPress 2.0,
6/12G SDI, 1/2.5/ 5/ 10G USXGMII, and USB 2.0 Gen1 and Gen2 protocols. It also includes USB 2.0, SD Card,
eMMC, PCIe® Gen2 x4 endpoint or root port, and a mikroBUS™ connector.

## Coming out of the box

The board is pre-programmed with a reference design booting Linux from eMMC.

![](./images/mpfs-video-kit-user-guide/mpfs-video-kit-terminals.png)

MMUART0 displays the Hart Software Service (HSS) boot messages. MMUART1 displays U-Boot messages, Linux boot messages and provides a Linux prompt. The default user name is "root". No password is required. If a password is requested at any stage "microchip" is used as default password.

## Description

This demo guide describes how to run H.264 video streaming over ethernet demo using Microchip’s PolarFire SoC Video Kit.
This kit features an MFS250T PolarFire SoC device. Microchip's PolarFire SoC devices combine RISC-V based 5x core Microprocessor Subsystem (MSS) capable of running Linux and the PolarFire FPGA Fabric in a single device.
This powerful combination enables the partitioning of user designs between the MSS (application code) and the fabric (HDL).
Microchip's Libero SoC enables the rapid development of RTL based designs for PolarFire SoC and many other device families.
Libero SoC provides a wide range of IP for a variety of applications such as video and imaging, signal processing, wired and wireless communications, and networking.
Microchip's SoftConsole enables the rapid development of C/C++ source code based applications targeted for all Microchip FPGA and SoC device families.

The demo captures live stream from a camera on a PolarFire SoC Video kit and performs H.264 compression using the FPGA fabric logic. A webserver application running on the MSS allows user to connect to the PolarFire SoC Video kit via ethernet.
Users can view the webserver by entering the IP address of the kit in a web browser. The webpage on the browser allows the user to control streaming of the live video from the Video kit to the connected system.
After the user initiates the stream on the webpage, the application running on the MSS reads a compressed stream of data from the fabric and sends encoded H.264 RTP ethernet packets to the IP address of the system which initiated the stream.
Users can play the video stream on a computer using applications such as VLC Media Player, Gstreamer or FFPlay. The webpage allows users to download an SDP file that can be passed on to the video player (VLC, Gstreamer, FFplay) after streaming is initiated.

## H.264 Compact Pipeline

Below block diagram explains the H.264 frame generation

![](./images/mpfs-video-kit-h264-demo/high-level-block-diagram.png)

Above diagram is for a simple H.264 base (compact) design and where one driver is used for all.

A modular pipeline architecture for H.264 video processing using IP cores in the fabric can provide significant flexibility and control over the video processing workflow. Each IP core that performs a specific function in the H.264 encoding process should have its own driver, and the pipeline connecting these cores should be defined through the device tree.

This modular approach allows for a high degree of customization, scalability, reusability, as each core can be independently developed, tested, and updated.

Refer to the [modular pipeline documentation](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/demo-guides-mpfs-video-kit-h264-modular-pipeline-demo)

## Running the Demo

The kit comes preprogrammed with a demonstrative design to run the PolarFire SoC H.264 demo. The preprogrammed design configures the ethernet ports on the Video kit with **static** IP addresses.
However, the Yocto images provided on the GitHub repository [Meta PolarFire SoC Yocto BSP](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/releases-meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp), configure the Video kit ethernet ports with **DHCP** IP addresses.

There are slight differences in the steps to run the demo depending on the static or DHCP IP addresses. To run the demo using static IP addresses, refer to the [Running the demo using static IP address](#runninng-the-demo-using-static-ip-address).

<a name="runninng-the-demo-using-dhcp"></a>

### Running the demo using DHCP

Follow the steps below to run the Demo using DHCP IP address:

1. Insert the dual camera sensor module into J10 on the PolarFire SoC Video kit. Ensure the lens caps are removed from the cameras.
2. Connect RJ45 ethernet cable between any one of the ethernet ports (connector J6 or J7) on the board and your network switch/router, Video kit will get a DHCP IP address once powered on.
3. From the Host PC open the browser (Chrome). Enter the IP address of the PolarFire SoC Video kit (assigned by DHCP) in the address bar.
4. The H.264 demo GUI will load automatically as shown in the image below:

### Running the demo using static IP address

To run the H.264 demo using the static IP address follow the steps provided in the [Quick Start Guide](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/v2/literature/DS50003455?version=latest&redirect=true).

<a name="on-screen-displayoverlay-controls"></a>

### On Screen Display(Overlay) Controls

The OSD (On Screen Display) feature overlays the amount of compression achieved in the encoding, in the form of: "COMPRESSION RATIO r" into the image frame, where r is the value of the ratio.
Each character in this text is 16x16 pixels, stored in the ROM. The text is displayed at the location specified by the input coordinates.
The encoding compression ratio is calculated by the driver dynamically and fed to the Fabric. The Fabric logic outputs RGB frame with the text added in the specified coordinates of the frame.
This feature is optional, and by default enabled.

<a name="horizontal-position"></a>

#### Horizontal Position

The user can change the OSD's horizontal position by changing the osdx-position using the following command:

   ```text
   v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-ctrl=osdx_position=675
   ```

<a name="vertical-position"></a>

#### Vertical Position

The user can change the OSD's vertical position by changing the osdy-position using the following command:

   ```text
   v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-ctrl=osdy_position=675
   ```

<a name="osd-disable"></a>

#### OSD disable

OSD feature is optional and can be disabled by the user. It is enabled by default.
To disable the OSD feature, set the osd_enable control to "0"

   ```text
   v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-ctrl=osd_enable=0
   ```

To enable the OSD feature, set the osd_enable control to "1"

   ```text
   v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-ctrl=osd_enable=1
   ```

<a name="osd-text-color"></a>

#### OSD Text Color

The color of the OSD text can be customized using RGB values.  
Each color red, green or blue has a 256 color combinations.  
The color of OSD text can be represented as 0xrrggbb.  
The OSD text can be modified using a 24 bit value (0xrrggbb) to get total 16M color combinations.  
The default color of the OSD text is white.  
User can extend to red, green and blue are each represented by 8-bit values, for a total of 16 million colour combinations.

The colour of the OSD text can be set to black using the following command:

   ```text
   v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-ctrl=osd_color=0x0
   ```

The colour of the OSD text can be set to red using the following command:

   ```text
   v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --set-ctrl=osd_color=0xff0000
   ```
